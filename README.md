6/1 [medium] [Facebook] : https://github.com/naashonomics/dailycodingproblem/blob/master/6_1_2019_Facebook.ipynb

Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded
.
For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.

You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed.


6/3: [hard] [Airbnb] https://github.com/naashonomics/dailycodingproblem/blob/master/6_3_2019_Airbnb.ipynb

Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.

Exmaple: For example, [2, 4, 6, 2, 5] should return 13, since we pick 2, 6, and 5. [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.

Follow-up: Can you do this in O(N) time and constant space?
